Title: LLM-enhanced Air Quality Monitoring Interface via Model Context Protocol

Abstract: Air quality monitoring is essential for environmental and public health, yet traditional systems remain difficult for non-experts to interpret due to complex interfaces and high costs. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can make sensor data more accessible, their tendency to hallucinate limits their use in safety-critical settings. To address this, we introduce an LLM-enhanced Air Monitoring Interface (AMI) that grounds LLM responses in real-time sensor data through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The system integrates a Django backend, a responsive dashboard, and a secure MCP server that exposes system functions as tools, allowing the LLM to provide accurate, context-aware guidance. Expert evaluation shows high factual accuracy (4.78), completeness (4.82), and minimal hallucinations (4.84). These results demonstrate that pairing LLMs with structured tool protocols can create reliable and user-friendly air quality monitoring systems.
